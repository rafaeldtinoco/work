Description: Global File System 2 - filesystem tools
 The Global File System allows a cluster of machines to concurrently access
 shared storage hardware like SANs or iSCSI and network block devices. GFS
 can be deployed to build high-availability services without the single point
 of failure of a file server.
 .
 This package contains tools for creating and managing global file systems.
 GFS itself is a set of kernel modules.
