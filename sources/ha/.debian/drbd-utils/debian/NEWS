drbd-utils (8.9.10-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The drbd service is now disabled by default on new installations. Upstream
  recommends that a cluster management software be used to control DRBD
  instead. If your setup relies on the drbd service however, you can still
  enable it using

    systemctl enable drbd.service

  or

    update-rc.d drbd enable

  Again, this applies only to new installations of the package, upgrades from
  older versions will leave the service intact.

drbd-utils (8.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  DRBD 8.4 includes a number of important changes from the 8.3 series, both
  in operation and in configuration files. An overview of these changes is
  provided upstream at:

           http://www.drbd.org/users-guide-8.4/ap-recent-changes.html

  Also, activating your DRBD 8.4 resources on older (pre-3.8) kernels will not
  work automatically, see /usr/share/doc/drbd8-utils/README.Debian for more
  information.
