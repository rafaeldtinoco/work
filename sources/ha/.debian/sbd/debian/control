Description: STONITH Block Device daemon
 SBD provides a node fencing mechanism (Shoot the other node in the
 head, STONITH) for Pacemaker-based clusters through the exchange of
 messages via shared block storage such as for example a SAN, iSCSI,
 FCoE. It can be used as a STONITH mechanism in all configurations
 that have reliable shared storage.
