Package: booth
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: lsb-base, ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: Cluster Ticket Manager
 Booth manages tickets which authorize cluster sites located in
 geographically dispersed locations to run resources. It
 facilitates support of geographically distributed clustering in
 Pacemaker.
 .
 Booth is based on the Raft consensus algorithm. Though the
 implementation is not complete (there is no log) and there are a
 few additions and modifications, booth guarantees that a ticket
 is always available at just one site as long as it has exclusive
 control of the tickets.
 .
 This package contains the booth daemon, and a script to run booth
 in standalone ("arbitrator") mode.
